Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

**Orange** — a C++17, ECS-driven application with a **plugin-based rendering
engine**. Render backends (OpenGL, Vulkan) are separate shared libraries
(`render_gl.dll`, `render_vk.dll`) loaded at runtime through a stable C ABI. The
app core never links GL/VK/SDL directly — it talks only to the abstract
`orange::render::IRenderer` (`engine/render_api`).

- **ECS, not a scene graph** — entities + components via [EnTT]. Systems
  transform the data; `renderSystem` is the bridge from ECS to draw calls.
- **Plugin boundary** — a backend exports three C symbols (`orangeRenderPluginInfo`,
  `orangeRenderCreate`, `orangeRenderDestroy`) and is checked against
  `ORANGE_PLUGIN_ABI_VERSION` at load.
- **Cross-platform by design** — [SDL3] handles window/input/GL-context/Vulkan-
  surface, so macOS/iOS/Android are additive, not a rewrite.

See `README.md` for the full architecture, the resource/buffer model, the axis
gizmo (ViewCube), and the controls.

## Geometry / IO / debug toolkit (ported from the Elements/Helium engine)

CPU, Eigen-backed, CUDA-free utilities that live in `orange_core` (headers under
`orange/core/`, sources under `engine/core/src/{geometry,io}/`):

- **`orange::geometry`** — `Morton3D` (Z-order keys), `Ray`/`AABB`
  (`geometry.h`), `SparseGrid` (hash grid; kNN + radius queries),
  `SparseDataBlock` (8³-block TSDF fused from an oriented point cloud via
  `fromPointsData`), and `generateMesh()` / `pointsToMesh()` — a dual-contouring
  surface extractor (the **points-in → mesh-out** pipeline). `std::execution::par`
  parallel; `marching_cubes_tables.h` holds the classic Bourke tables.
- **`orange::io`** — `serialization.h`: multi-format mesh/point-cloud read+write
  (XYZ/OFF/STL/OBJ/PLY/PTS/ALP/CSV) via `HSerializable`. `reconstructMeshFromFile()`
  bridges a loaded point cloud into `pointsToMesh`. (appOrange's `mesh_io.h` is the
  separate, render-facing OBJ/STL/PLY *loader* that fills `render::Vertex`.)
- **`orange::color`** — `color.h`: named colors, HSV↔RGB, heatmap, maximin
  contrasting palettes.
- **`orange::debug`** — `debug_draw.h`: immediate-mode `DebugDraw` singleton
  (`addLine/addBox/addWireBox/addSphere/addTriangle`). The renderSystem uploads
  the accumulated triangles as one dynamic non-indexed mesh each frame, then
  clears. Since the renderer has no line primitive, lines/wire boxes are emitted
  as thin triangle tubes.
- **Third-party:** `robin_hood` (header-only hash map) vendored under
  `engine/third_party/` (used by `SparseGrid`).

## Layout

```
engine/                  the reusable engine (CMake: add_subdirectory(engine))
  render_api/            interface-only C-ABI contract (header library) — no GL/VK/SDL
  core/                  platform layer + ECS (components, systems, app loop, window)
  plugins/render_gl/     OpenGL 3.3 backend plugin
  plugins/render_vk/     Vulkan backend plugin (built only if a Vulkan SDK is found)
  cmake/OrangeApp.cmake  orange_add_app() — the entry point every app uses
app/appOrange/           demo app: three spinning cubes via ECS (also hosts font/UI impl)
```

**Engine / app split.** The top-level CMake is a thin superbuild: it fetches deps,
then `add_subdirectory(engine)` (core + render plugins) and one `add_subdirectory`
per app. The engine never depends on any app, so multiple apps can sit on one
engine. An app is a thin consumer — `orange_add_app(<name> SOURCES ...)` links
`orange::core` + SDL3, builds the render plugins alongside it, and (on Windows)
copies SDL3.dll next to the exe. Apps talk only to `orange::core`, never GL/VK/SDL.
To add an app: new `app/<name>/` with a one-line `orange_add_app()` + an
`add_subdirectory(app/<name>)` in the root.

## Build & run

Requires CMake ≥ 3.21 and a C++17 compiler. SDL3, EnTT, and stb are fetched via
FetchContent on first configure (needs network). All binaries land in the bin
output dir so the app finds plugins next to itself.

Generic (per README):
```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Debug
./build/bin/appOrange            # OpenGL (default)
./build/bin/appOrange --vulkan   # Vulkan
```

### ⚠️ This Windows machine (D:\Library\Orange)

The shell has `cl`/`ninja` on PATH but **NOT** the full MSVC env (no
`INCLUDE`/`VCINSTALLDIR`), so **Ninja fails**. Use the Visual Studio generator:

```sh
cmake -S D:/Library/Orange -B D:/Library/Orange/build -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64
cmake --build D:/Library/Orange/build --config Debug
```

- Vulkan SDK is at `C:\VulkanSDK\1.4.350.0` (installed via
  `winget install KhronosGroup.VulkanSDK`), so `render_vk` builds here.
  `VULKAN_SDK` is set machine-wide, but a fresh shell may not have it yet —
  if CMake reports "Vulkan SDK not found", set `$env:VULKAN_SDK` for the
  session, delete `build/CMakeCache.txt`, and reconfigure.
- Binaries land in `build/bin/Debug`. Run `appOrange.exe` (GL) or
  `appOrange.exe --vulkan`.

## Key facts to keep in mind

- **Plugin ABI is v10.** Changing the C contract means bumping
  `ORANGE_PLUGIN_ABI_VERSION` and updating both backends. v6 added
  `IRenderer::setVsync(bool)` (GL flips the swap interval; VK recreates the
  swapchain with a FIFO / immediate-mailbox present mode). v7 added
  `IRenderer::drawGrid()`. v8 made it `drawGrid(int upAxis)` (1 = Y up, 2 = Z up)
  — the axis arg only recolors the in-plane depth line, not the grid plane. v9
  added `IRenderer::setDrawMode(uint32_t)`. v10 redefined it to **Helium's
  Renderable drawing modes** (0 = none, 1 = solid, 2 = wireframe, 3 =
  wireframe-over-solid, 4 = point): GL mirrors Helium's `DrawImplementation`
  (`glPolygonMode` + `glPointSize` + `glPolygonOffset` for the over-solid pass);
  VK binds the matching fill/line/point pipeline (needs the `fillModeNonSolid` +
  `largePoints` device features; the fill pipeline carries a small depth bias so
  the over-solid edges sit on top, and mode 3 double-draws). **Tab** cycles the
  modes — handled in `Application` (writes `core::DrawModeState` into the registry
  ctx); the `renderSystem` applies it to scene meshes only, resetting to solid
  before the debug geometry, grid and overlays.
- **Infinite grid:** `renderSystem` calls `IRenderer::drawGrid(upAxis)` after the
  scene submits (before the gizmo overlay). Each backend renders a vertex-less
  full-screen pass (GL: inline shader + empty VAO; VK: a second pipeline +
  `shaders/grid.{vert,frag}` → SPIR-V) that ray-casts each pixel onto the world
  y=0 plane and draws `fwidth`-based AA grid lines with distance fade and correct
  depth (so the scene occludes it). `upAxis` colors the in-plane depth axis line
  blue (Z, Y-up) or green (Y, Z-up); GL passes a `uUpAxis` uniform, VK an `int` at
  push-constant offset 128. Each plugin inverts its own clip-corrected `viewProj`
  for the unprojection (the host doesn't, since VK's correction is plugin-side).
- **Up-axis (Y/Z) toggle:** a small "Y"/"Z" button in the gizmo's bottom-left
  corner (`AxisGizmo::zUp`, hit-tested in `axisGizmoInputSystem` via
  `upToggleRect`). It is a real coordinate-frame change, **not** a camera spin: a
  world up-axis basis `Mworld` (identity for Y up, `rotateX(-90°)` for Z up, so a
  model's logical +Z maps to render +Y) is prepended to every renderable's model
  in `renderSystem` and to the gizmo cube (`conjugate(camOrient)·Mworld`). The
  camera and the horizontal y=0 grid stay put; content is re-expressed in the new
  frame (a Z-up mesh stands up under Z up). The grid's depth-axis line recolors
  (blue Z → green Y) via the `drawGrid` arg. Picking undoes `Mworld` on the ray;
  gizmo cube-face snaps map the picked logical axis back through `Mworld`. Helpers
  `worldUpQuat/worldUpMatrix/worldZUp` live in `systems.cpp`.
- **Buffers are two-layer:** handle + byte-size based ABI in `render_api`, and a
  type-safe `core::Buffer<T>` (VertexBuffer/IndexBuffer/UniformBuffer) in
  `engine/core/include/orange/core/buffer.h` that wraps it with RAII. App code
  uses the template layer.
- **Vulkan shaders:** `engine/plugins/render_vk/shaders/*.{vert,frag}` are compiled to
  SPIR-V headers in `src/generated/` (CMake regenerates on change via the Vulkan
  SDK's glsl compiler). GL→VK clip-space correction (Y flip + depth 0..1) is
  applied so both backends show the identical scene.
- **Math is Eigen-backed.** Code uses the Eigen types directly —
  `Eigen::Vector3f/Vector4f/Matrix4f/Quaternionf` (column-major, GL convention);
  there are no `Vec3`/`Mat4`/... type aliases. `orange/core/math.h` keeps thin
  graphics helpers in `namespace orange::math` (`perspective`/`ortho`/`lookAt`/
  `quatAxisAngle`/`toMat4`/...). Eigen is fetched via FetchContent (find_package
  first). The build defines `EIGEN_MAX_ALIGN_BYTES=0` so Eigen members are safe
  inside EnTT pools. Interop with the render ABI's `float[16]`/`float[3]` is via
  `.data()`. Use `.x()/.y()/.z()` (methods), not `.x`, and construct with
  `Eigen::Vector3f(a,b,c)` / `Eigen::Quaternionf::Identity()` (the default Eigen
  ctor leaves values uninitialized).
- **No gimbal lock:** `Transform::orientation` is a unit quaternion; the camera
  is a quaternion arcball trackball (`CameraManipulator`). Any camera controller
  is just a system that writes a `Transform`.
- **Input scheme:** right-drag orbits, middle-drag pans, wheel zooms, and
  **left-click picks** the nearest `Renderable` via `pickingSystem` (builds a
  world ray from the camera and ray-tests each entity's local AABB; the hit gets
  `Renderable::selected`). UI widgets set `Input::captured` to suppress picking.
  **Tab** cycles the scene drawing mode (Helium's set: none / solid / wireframe /
  wireframe-over-solid / point); **M** cycles the point-cloud processing mode;
  **C** screenshots; **Esc** quits.
- **Processing modes (`orange::modes`):** the Orange take on Hydrogen's "apps" —
  selectable point-cloud operations that run on a `modes::ModeInput` (stored in
  the registry ctx) and emit a visualization via the debug-draw accumulator.
  `processingModeSystem` runs the active mode (`modes::ModeState` ctx) only when
  the selection changes (cached), re-emitting each frame. The four ported,
  CUDA/Helium-free modes: **Clustering** (SparseGrid radius + union-find),
  **Morphology** (voxel erode + largest connected component), **SDF Filter**
  (UDF splat + box blur + iso-surface resample), **Reconstruct** (TSDF →
  `pointsToMesh`). appOrange feeds a deterministic sample cloud; **M** cycles.
  (Adding a mode = one function + an entry in `kModes` in `modes.cpp`.)
- **Text/UI:** gizmo labels and FPS/controls widgets are rasterized with
  stb_truetype (loads `C:/Windows/Fonts/malgun.ttf` on Windows) into RGBA atlases
  drawn as textured overlay quads via `IRenderer::beginOverlay`. Overlay layers
  need distinct z or depth-test rejects coplanar quads. stb pack glyph quad size
  must use `xoff2-xoff` (not `x1-x0`) or oversampled glyphs render 2× too big.
- **Screenshot:** press `C` to save `orange_capture.png` next to the exe
  (`IRenderer::readPixels`, GL only). Useful to verify rendering visually.
